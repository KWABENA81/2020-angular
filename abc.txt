Your first time with git and github

If you’ve never used git or github before, there are a bunch of things that you need to do. It’s very well explained on github, but repeated here for completeness.

    Get a github account.
    Download and install git.

    Set up git with your user name and email.

        Open a terminal/shell and type:

        $ git config --global user.name "Solomon SAK"
        $ git config --global user.email "kwabena81@yahoo.com"

        (Don’t type the $; that just indicates that you’re doing this at the command line.)

        I also do:

        Enable colored output in the terminal;
	$ git config --global color.ui true

        Set git that you want to use vim.
	$ git config --global core.editor vim

         

 #	Set up ssh on your computer. 
See github’s guide to generating SSH keys.
Look to see if you have files ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

If not, create such public/private keys: Open a terminal/shell and type:
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "kwabena81@yahoo.com"

Copy your public key (the contents of the newly-created id_rsa.pub file) into your clipboard. 

On a Mac, in the terminal/shell, type:
        $ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    Paste your ssh public key into your github account settings.
        Go to your github Account Settings
        Click “SSH Keys” on the left.
        Click “Add SSH Key” on the right.
        Add a label (like “My laptop”) and paste the public key into the big text box.

        In a terminal/shell, type the following to test it:

        $ ssh -T git@github.com

        If it says something like the following, it worked:

        Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does
        not provide shell access.
